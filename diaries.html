    <h2>Time Management Principles</h2>

<p>We keep a hold of the anecdote told regarding differing responses from the American and Russian space agencies regarding the dilemma of ball point pens not working in space, due to the absence of gravity. The Americans spent over a million dollars inserting a pressurised unit into the pen to force the ink out, the Russians used pencils! Life in the twenty-first century is rapid and often complex. Some of the tools we use to negotiate need to be complex such as software for accounting and the array of medical equipment for fighting disease. However, when it comes to time management, simplicity is the most successful approach.</p>

<p>Firstly, use the Bush Solutions Guide to Success to determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The year at a glance; to record all the important dates of birthdays, anniversaries, peak work times, school etc. If you have children or grandchildren at school, work activities make sure you are spreading the load and not overloading yourself at any particular time as well as leaving time for recreation.</li>
<li>A Monthly span to break the annual plan into smaller chunks. </li>
<li>Weekly span to plan out your time in detail</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you to manage your time more efficiently and be used in a more productive manner. </p>
